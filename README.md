Application I plan to build:
I plan to build an application that streamlines the housing selection process in my university. Users will be students. The app will include a database of all available room and suite configurations organized by residential hall and building. The app will allow each user to create accounts and view available suites/rooms in detail, including floor plans. They will be able to view the level of interest there is for those suites/rooms from other students which is essential since housing is conducted through a lottery, and students like to gauge their chances in order to adjust their plans accordingly. It will also allow them to create shared groups and link their accounts with other users they wish to be roommates/suitemates with. They will have the option to select a limited number of suite configurations that they are interested in. Based on the information they provide when creating accounts, the app will only allow them to select suites/rooms that are available to the type of student they are. For instance, certain suites are only available to sophomores, etc. They will also only be able to form groups with other students from their class.

## Notes

The main challenege I encountered was in familiarizing myself with Swift and the syntax. It was difficult to implement all the features and functionality I wished to in an unfamiliar language. Despite this, I am taking advantage of various resources and using my experience with other object-oriented programming languages to improve my proficiency.
